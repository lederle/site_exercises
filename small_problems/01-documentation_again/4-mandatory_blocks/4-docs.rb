# The Array#bsearch method is used to search ordered Arrays more quickly than #find and #select can. Assume you have the following code:

a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]

# How would you search this Array to find the first element whose value exceeds 8?

# signature:
# bsearch {|x| block } â†’ elem 
# bsearch takes one arg, a block. The block is required, and takes one
# argument.

p a.bsearch {|x| x > 8}
