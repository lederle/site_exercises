# Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

# Numbers

# You can write integers of any size as follows:

p 1234
p 1_234
 
# These numbers have the same value, 1,234. The underscore may be used to enhance readability for humans. You may place an underscore anywhere in the number.
