# Write a loop that prints numbers 1-5 and whether the number is even or odd. Use the code below to get started.

count = 1

loop do
  puts "#{count} is odd!" if count.odd?
  puts "#{count} is even!" if count.even?
  count += 1
  break if count > 5
end

# Expected output:

# 1 is odd!
# 2 is even!
# 3 is odd!
# 4 is even!
# 5 is odd!
