# In the previous exercise, you wrote a program that asks the user if they want the program to print "something". However, this program recognized any input as valid: if you answered anything but y, it treated it as an n response, and quit without printing anything.

# Modify your program so it prints an error message for any inputs that aren't y or n, and then asks you to try again. Keep asking for a response until you receive a valid y or n response. In addition, your program should allow both Y and N (uppercase) responses; case sensitive input is generally a poor user interface choice. Whenever possible, accept both uppercase and lowercase inputs.

# Examples:

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# y
# something

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# help
# >> Invalid input! Please enter y or n
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# Y
# something

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# N

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# NO
# >> Invalid input! Please enter y or n
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# n

loop do
  puts "Do you want me to print something? (y/n)"
  input = gets.chomp.downcase
  unless input == 'y' || input == 'n'
    puts "Invalid input! Please enter y or n"
    next
  end
  puts "something" if input == 'y'
  break
end

#choice = nil
#loop do
#  puts '>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)'
#  choice = gets.chomp.downcase
#  break if %w(y n).include?(choice)
#  puts '>> Invalid input! Please enter y or n'
#end
#puts 'something' if choice == 'y'
